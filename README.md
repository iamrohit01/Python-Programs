# Python Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python programs demonstrating various concise and expressive features of the language.

## Program Descriptions

*   [program\_1.py](program_1.py): Demonstrates list comprehensions for creating lists in a concise way, including squaring numbers and filtering even numbers.
*   [program\_2.py](program_2.py): Shows dictionary comprehensions for creating dictionaries concisely, specifically creating a dictionary of cubes.
*   [program\_3py](program_3py): Illustrates the use of lambda functions for small, anonymous functions, often used with `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.
*   [program\_4.py](program_4.py): Presents a generator function (`fibonacci_generator`) that returns an iterator, producing a Fibonacci sequence on the fly using the `yield` keyword.

## Usage

Each program is self-contained and can be run directly using a Python interpreter. For example:

```bash
python program_1.py
