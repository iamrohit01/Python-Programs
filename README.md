# Python Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python programs demonstrating various concise and expressive features of the language

## Program Descriptions

*   [program\_1.py](program_1.py): Demonstrates list comprehensions for creating lists in a concise way, including squaring numbers and filtering even numbers.
*   [program\_2.py](program_2.py): Shows dictionary comprehensions for creating dictionaries concisely, specificall creating a dictionary of cubes.
*   [program\_4.py](program_4.py): Presents a generator function (`fibonacci_generator`) that returns an iterator, producing a Fibonacci sequence on the fly using the `yield` keyword.
*   [program\_5.py](program_5.py): Implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a doubly linked list and a dictionary for efficient get and put operations.
*   [program\_6.py](program_6.py): Demonstrates asynchronous HTTP requests using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to fetch content from multiple URLs concurrently.
*   [program\_7.py](program_7.py): Uses a context manager (`Timer` class) to measure the execution time of code blocks.
*   [program\_8.py](program_8.py): Implements a retry decorator that retries a function upon encountering specified exceptions, with configurable retries, delay, and backoff.
*   [program\_9.py](program_9.py): Shows an Event Manager class that allows subscribing to and triggering events, enabling a publish-subscribe pattern.
*   [program\_10.py](program_10.py): Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
*   [program\_11.py](program_11.py): Solves the coin change problem using dynamic programming to find the minimum number of coins needed for a given amount.
*   [program\_12.py](program_12.py): Implements a Trie data structure with insert, search, and starts\_with methods for efficient string prefix searching.
*   [program\_13.py](program_13.py): Demonstrates concurrent task execution using `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module.

## Usage:

Each program is self-contained and can be run directly using a Python interpreter.To run a program, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute:

```bash
python program_name.py
